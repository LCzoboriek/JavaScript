<h1>Linked local inline examples</h1>
<button onclick="sayHi()">Say hi</button>
<body>
<script src="external.js"></script>
<!-- inline here will now overrite the external script above -->
<script>
    function sayHi(){
        alert("Hi inline!");
    }
</script>
<button onclick="function sayHi() { alert('Hi inline!'); } sayHi() ">Say hi</button>
</body>
<!-- The inline code takes precedence over local code which takes precedence over external code. Having said that, like CSS, external JS code is preferred for the reasons of the fact that its more
utilised throughout code, and is cleaner -->
<!-- The order of the scripts determine what is executed and overwritten, you normaly put your linked scripts before your local ones, as the local ones will override anything they have in common -->
