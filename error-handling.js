// Error handling in javascripot, you have things like Throw, Try and Catch
// Most commonly you just wrap the code block you think is causing an error 
// in a try block, immediately after the code a catch(error) alert is called
// with an identifier for what error is happening
// You can also make your program throw an error for example if someone doesnt
// enter a number in a dialog, you can throw an error with a type check
